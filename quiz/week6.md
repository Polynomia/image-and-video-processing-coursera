## Q1
What shapes have constant Euclidean curvature?

#### Answer
Straight lines and Circles.

#### Explanation
The Euclidean curvature is zero for straight lines, and 1/radius for circles.

## Q2
The gradient of a function f(x,y) is

#### Answer
Perpendicular to the level lines of f(x,y).

## Q3
Consider the functional ($\int | \nabla I |^p $) for an image $I(x,y)$ and $p > 0$. For which $p$ the Euler-Lagrange of the functional will lead to anisotropic diffusion?

#### Answer
$p=1$

#### Explanation
We have seen that for $p=1$ this gives “curvature motion,” a type of anisotropic diffusion. For $p=2$ this gives the isotropic diffusion or heat flow. For $p>2$ we also get additional diffusion across edges instead of reduced diffusion.

## Q4
Considering a planar curve C embedded as the zero level set of a function f(x,y). The curve moves with constant velocity. Then f(x,y) is deforming according to

#### Answer
$f_t = |\nabla f|$

#### Explanation
We have demonstrated that the general motion is $f_t = V \ |\nabla f|$ when the curve is moving with speed V in the normal direction. In this case (constant motion) V=1.

## Q5   
Consider a circle of radius 1/8. What is the relationship between the affine arc-length $dv$ and the Euclidean arc-length $ds$ for this circle?

#### Answer
$dv = 2ds$

#### Explanation
$dv= \kappa^{1/3}  ds$

## Q6
Consider a planar shape in an image, with its boundary deforming with only tangential velocity. What will happen to the object inside such boundary?

#### Answer
It will not change.

## Q7
Considering an image with only circular objects of known radius. Which of the following techniques would you use to detect their centers:

#### Answer
Hough transform
